# React Readable
Readable is a dynamic social application using the state management features of Redux and React.

In Readable users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.


This is the second project for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)'s [React Developer Nanoderee](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
